Classification Server
A simple HTTP server that provides an interface to a number of classifiers.  Since communication is performed over HTTP, practically every implementation language can take advantage of it.

Initial Focus
- Binary classifiers
- Floating point vector data
- Scalar confidence values

Goals
1. HTTP interface to a variety of classifiers
2. Client implementations for common languages (C/C++/Python/Matlab)
3. Simplify classifier comparison
4. Provide standard evaluation metrics and visualizations

Classification Server
A simple HTTP server that provides an interface to a number of classifiers.  Since communication is performed over HTTP, practically every implementation language can take advantage of it.

Initial Focus
- Binary classifiers
- Floating point vector data
- Scalar confidence values

Goals
- HTTP interface to a variety of classifiers
- Client implementations for common languages (C/C++/Python/Matlab)
- Simplify classifier comparison
- Provide standard evaluation metrics and visualizations
- Provide standard operations such as train, test, and cross-validation
- Stay simple!

Metrics
- Accuracy
- Mean Squared Error
- Squared Correlation Coefficient

Plots
- PR Curve
- ROC Curve
